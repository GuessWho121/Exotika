# Docker specific ignores (already in .dockerignore, but good to have here too)
# These are typically not committed to git, but are generated by Docker
# if you're running local Docker builds or volumes.
# However, the Dockerfiles and docker-compose files themselves should be committed.
# No need to explicitly ignore Dockerfile* or docker-compose* here as they are source files.
# The .dockerignore file itself should also be committed.
# For any local Docker volumes or build caches that might appear outside of node_modules/dist:
